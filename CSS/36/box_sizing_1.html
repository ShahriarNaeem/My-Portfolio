      When we use box-sizing oreder in css, then nothing can't overlap the box,
      or nothing go out of the box.After using padding the area also increase
      and didn't follow the specified width and height..so box-sizing will make
      the box fixed
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="C"><input type="text" /></div>
    <p>
      same width, but overlapping, so using box-sizing for not overlapping the
      area..
    </p>
    <br />
    <div class="D"><input type="text" /></div>
    <hr />
    we can also use box-sizing at the top of the css for applying box-sizing
    property for all elements of the page...so this wlll be the code for that,"
    * { box-sizing: border-box; } "
