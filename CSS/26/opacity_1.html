    here I can use the value of opacity "0-1";When anyone hover over the
    photo,then I will be "a white/transperant tint"...Now I am taking another
    picture by "css",then writting a text on it and will place the "text" inthe
    middle of the image.....
    <hr />
    <div class="A">
      <div class="B">This will show in middle</div>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <h1>
      Here I used "opacity:.5" for the text so its looking transperant,When I
      was using "top margin",the photo also going down,to prohibit this
      situaton,I have used "overflow:hidden" for the image..as the text "div"
      included of the image "div" tag the "width & height" also working for the
      text.......
