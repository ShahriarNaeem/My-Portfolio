  When I trying to change text style in between line tag,then this will look
  like below
</h1><div style="color: Red;">This is red</div>
<hr>
</hr>
<h2>
  This line will be colored or changed by "style" that I have used in the
  "head" tag and this is called "internal style"
</h2>
<hr>
</hr>

  "css" file that i want to add </p>
